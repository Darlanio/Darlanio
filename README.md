- 👋 Hi, I’m @Darlanio
- 👀 I’m interested in software development in general and application development for Android, with or without neural network specifically.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the new features of .NET Core 6.0 / C# 10.0.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment.
- 📫 You can email me or phone me, which ever suits you best... but only if you have my email or phonenumber of course. ;-)
